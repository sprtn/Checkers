This is my group exam from the fall 2016 semester at school. We created Checkers (all code from scratch).

We were graded C. Our grade suffered from the fact that we didn't copy/paste from the net, which we apparently was allowed to do (something we found out after delivering the exam.)

The program contains a few bugs, most noticably the fact that draw's dont work.

I, personally, wrote most of the gameLogic, as well as a lot of the other code. I barely touched the clientAndServer code, which turned out nicely. (Good group members)
Overall, I am pretty proud of the project, barring the fact that we got such a bad grade. There are many things I would change if I were to do it all over.
